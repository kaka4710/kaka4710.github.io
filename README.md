## About Me

Hello there! My name is X.Yin, a teacher. Ever since I developed an interest in plant Ecology, I have been continuously learning and exploring in this domain. I am passionate about Using R for analyse and enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with others.


Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope we have the chance to communicate and collaborate!
